5. Enter a word and a file name in the form.
6. Click the "Count" button to display the number of times the word appears in the file.
7. How it Works.

## How it Works

The PHP script reads the contents of the specified text file and uses the substr_count function to count the number of occurrences of the specified word. The count is then returned to the JavaScript function, which updates the HTML to display the count on the web page.
